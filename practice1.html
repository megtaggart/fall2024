Popular Halloween activities include trick-or-treating, (or the related guising and souling), attending Halloween costume parties, 
carving pumpkins or turnips into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, divination games, playing pranks, visiting haunted attractions, 
telling scary stories, and watching horror or Halloween-themed films. Some people practice the Christian observances of All Hallows' Eve,
including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead, although it is a secular celebration for others.
Some Christians historically abstained from meat on All Hallows' Eve, a tradition reflected in the eating of certain vegetarian foods on this vigil day, 
including apples, potato pancakes, and soul cakes.
